```lrc
[00:14.32] If I die
[00:17.37] In this world
[00:20.41] Who will know
[00:23.65] Something of me
[00:26.98] I am lost
[00:29.93] No one knows
[00:33.29] There's no trace
[00:36.66] Of my yearning
[00:39.76] If I die (but I must)
[00:42.91] In this world (carry on)
[00:46.18] Who will know (nothing worse)
[00:49.27] Something of me (can befall)
[00:52.79] I am lost (all my fears)
[00:55.81] No one knows (all my tears)
[00:59.00] There's no trace (tell my heart)
[01:02.12] Of my yearning (there's a hole)
[01:06.89] I wear a void
[01:12.86] Not even hope
[01:19.33] A downward slope
[01:25.93] Is all I see
[01:32.15] I wear a void (as long as breath comes from my mouth)
[01:38.50] Not even hope (I may yet stand the slightest chance)
[01:44.81] A downward slope (a shaft of light is all I need)
[01:51.34] Is all I see (to cease the darkness killing me)
[01:58.40] (music)
